# cidr_filter

This is a script I have used in threat hunting to exclude Microsoft CIDR ranges from hunt data. Can be useful when you have lots outbound network connections and want to remove known ranges such as Microsoft. 

Next:
- add more known CIDR ranges
- add possibility include more than one range
