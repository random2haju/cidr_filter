# cidr_filter

This is a script I have used in threat hunting to exclude Microsoft IP ranges from hunt data. Can be useful when you have lots outbound network connections and want to remove known ranges such as Microsoft. 

Next:
- add more known ranges
- add possibility include more than one range
